# stock-analysis
This is a repository for analysis of stocks.

## Overview of Project 
Steve has been researching stocks to assist his parents in investing. We assisted him in writing a VBA code for specific Green Stocks. After running this analysis, he decided that we should refactor this code to run faster because it is too slow if there are many more stocks in the dataset. Given this challenge, we refactored the code to run faster and prepare him to research many more stocks. After refactoring this code to make in run more quickly, we are ready to analyze the results our dataset and code.
